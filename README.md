ContactList
===========

This program is supposed to hold contact information of people you know.

This program uses:

+Python 3.4.2
+Tkinter
+File writing and reading functions in python

This program is solely dependent on python 3.4.2 using Tkinter as its gui tool.
This is the first GUI program that I have written and as a concequence I wanted it to look wacky, and it does!

When it displays the available contacts, it unfortunately does it in a very weird way.

This program also requires that you have everything in your immediate directory, I may update with tkfiledialog later, 
if I remember, or haven't moved on with my life.
